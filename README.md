# Student Companion App

This is a student companion app built based on this [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/4b6ce9a7-f7b8-4bd1-a5ac-f8a8a924be3e).

It was originally built in plain HTML and CSS and later included Vanilla JS. It integrates first iterations of posting and fetching journal posts from an API and storing them to Local Storage. It was built as a group project as part of my neuefische bootcamp.

## Installation

After cloning this repository, simply run `npm install` in the main directory.

## Enjoy!
